## What this project is
Given an image of 'a straight line over a coordinate plane' and a text input of 'scale of of the coordinate system', the program could provide the approximated equation for the line.

### What is the purpose of making this project
The purpose of making this project is to showcase my depth of understanding of applied deep learning skills. 

As the project is purely different than the traditional projects available online, It won't give a feeling of the project being copied from somewhere else.

### Usecase
I believe, the project could be taken as a nice example to show case different concepts of applied deep learning such as - 

 - Using synthetic data for training
 - The right ways for Data Augmentation
 
### Works done during the development of this project
 - Collection of Data Samples from the original distribution
 - Training the model
 - Setting up a AWS Linux Instance
 - Deploying the model and providing the APIs for usage
 - Setting up a minimal GUI for the system to be used by anyone
